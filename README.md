### Hi, Welcome to my webpage
##### I'm Dhruv, Here are some things About Me
---------------------
- Ok Let's Start with my Hobbies
1. Rubik's Cube
2. Gaming
3. Debugging
4. Cooking
5. And lastly Designing

## Well that settles the Hobby's part
Now coming onto the projects I've made:
1. Library Made Easy 
  -A Library management system made for college projects which I'm pretty proud of.
   Ofcourse there are some bugs and it's rough around the edges but still...

2. Color changing lamp using Arduino
It Was a pretty good project which worked using the principle of Scattering of light
It used Arduino as a servo controller with 24 combinations natively
It could've been tweaked a lot more so there could be around 35000 combinations 
Sounds crazy right !

3. More one the way...
